<p>GRO seeks to provide Deaf young adults with the requisite skills and positive reinforcement to inspire them to think beyond their social constructs and aim to succeed. GRO's proprietary training program is equipped to "enable the disabled", by training Deaf individuals to become productive, and thriving, agents of change within their communities; thereby, improving the quality of life and sustainability of the Deaf community in India.</p>

<h2>GRO Modules</h2>

<p><b>Instill Training:</b> GRO modules will provide specialized training on leadership and management skills to Deaf participants.</p>
 
<p><b>Incubate:</b> New Businesses and Future Leaders: GRO will create partnerships with local municipalities, businesses, and NGOs to collaborate with the Centre in varying degrees, e.g., commit to hire Deaf individuals from the program into management/leadership career trajectories.</p>
 
<p><b>Inspire Change:</b> Through its demonstrable results, GRO will reconstruct the vocabulary entrenched within society that casts Deaf individuals as “disabled” pariahs, unable to obtain meaningful employment or participate in their local communities as vibrant citizens.  Ultimately, this evolution in perspectives about the Deaf will enable advocacy efforts for positive reforms to neutralize embedded stigmas in Indian society that detrimentally impact Deaf individuals and their families.</p>
