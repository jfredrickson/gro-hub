title: 'India: The Need'

<p>Data from the World Health Organization indicates that there are approximately 278 million Deaf people worldwide. 80% of the Deaf demographic lives in low/middle-income countries. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, at least 90% of Deaf people live in developing countries, totaling over 200 million people.</p>

<p>In India, there are approximately 12 million Deaf people, 80% of whom have no access to any formal education. There are approximately 500 government sponsored Deaf schools across India that, based on their English colonial histories, offer a basic education to the Deaf using an oral-approach and discourage the use of Indian local sign languages. Due to this punitive approach to Deaf education, the Indian Deaf population has reported markedly low literacy rates and lacks a solid foundation in academics, life skills, and social skills. These deficient conditions lead to a significantly high unemployment rate for the Deaf demographic in India and consequently exacerbate an array of ancillary societal issues stemming from unemployment.</p>

<p>While several institutions of higher learning in India presently provide Deaf individuals with the opportunity to obtain Bachelor's Degrees in the fields of computer technology, business, and the fine arts, there is insufficient research to demonstrate whether these programs have been successful, and Deaf graduates from such programs will continue to face challenges transitioning into the workplace. Severe misconceptions continue to exist across Indian society about the Deaf, due to failures in communication and the lack of an enabling working vocabulary of empowerment and capability.</p>

<p>Development work relating to Deaf communities generally focuses on early childhood education. While the goal of educating Deaf youth is an extremely important one, there is a pressing need for programs that focus on imparting skills development and vocational training to Deaf young adults and adults, irrespective of any prior formal education. There is also a compelling need for thoughtful and effective advocacy initiatives that can implement policies to protect and nurture Deaf individuals within their communities and provide tailored resources to enable the Deaf to succeed and thrive.</p>

<p>GRO seeks to create sustainable models of employment for the Deaf and impart leadership, management and entrepreneurial skill sets, to engender a new paradigm of accomplishment and possibility for the Deaf in India.</p>
