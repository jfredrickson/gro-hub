# Global Reach Out Website

This is the Global Reach Out website, [http://www.globalreachout.org](http://www.globalreachout.org/).

It is a Jekyll website targeting the GitHub Pages platform.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

You will need Ruby installed, preferably via a version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). You'll also need the `bundler` gem, which you can install by running `gem install bundler`.

### Running locally

Clone the repository, then run `bundle install`, which will install the `github-pages` gem and its dependencies.

Now you can run the website locally: `bundle exec rake serve`
